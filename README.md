## Nasa-Astroid-App

### In this app you can find astroid details with its astroid id and get details like:

1. Name of the astroid
2. URL of the astroid for details from Official NASA website
3. Is astroid is hazardous or not

### In this app I used router for routing pages and context api for state management

### I used axios for fetching data
